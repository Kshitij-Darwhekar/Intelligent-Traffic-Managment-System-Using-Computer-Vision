<p class="text-justify">
We created the Intelligent Traffic Management System
using computer vision and YOLO V3 algorithm to solve traffic congestion problem without any human intervention.
This technology tries to monitor and manage traffic flow. Traffic police manage
traffic using timer-based traffic signals in conventional traffic management systems.
However, using such technologies, it becomes difficult for traffic authorities to control
traffic congestion in various places with a constrained staff.
